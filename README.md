---
## Overview of the Statistical Analysis:
Two female entrepreneurs are interested in starting a summer bike sharing business in Des Moines, Iowa after seeing the success of the business in NYC called NYC Citi Bike. In order to start this business, they need to pitch the idea to potential investors using visualizations based on the NYC Citi Bike data. From these visualizations, they will be able to convince investors that the business has lots of potential to be a successful venture, and can figure out a marketing strategy to propel their business to success.

![Bike Sharing Analysis](https://github.com/mbroad1/Module-14-Bike-Sharing-Analysis/blob/main/Number%20of%20Rides.png)
- According to the NYC Citi Bike data, millions of people rent their bikes, especially in the month of August.

![Bike Sharing Analysis](https://github.com/mbroad1/Module-14-Bike-Sharing-Analysis/blob/main/Customers.png)
- Of these millions of customers that rent their bikes in August, the vast majority are subscribers, meaning that they are regular customers that are likely to use the bikes more than just in the month of August.

![Bike Sharing Analysis](https://github.com/mbroad1/Module-14-Bike-Sharing-Analysis/blob/main/August%20Peak%20Hours.png)
- Customers generally rent bikes in the morning or late afternoon to evening. As seen by the x-axis, hundreds of thousands of people rent these bikes during the month of August, meaning it is a popular activity.

![Bike Sharing Analysis](https://github.com/mbroad1/Module-14-Bike-Sharing-Analysis/blob/main/Trips%20by%20Weekday%20per%20Hour.png)
- According to the heat map, NYC Citi Bike receives a lot of business every single day of the week, making it a successful business.
- People like to ride their bikes during the morning or evening of Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday.
- There is consistent business all hours on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.

![Bike Sharing Analysis](https://github.com/mbroad1/Module-14-Bike-Sharing-Analysis/blob/main/Checkout%20Times%20for%20Users.png)
- Typically, customers will ride for 20 minutes or less.
- The max time that they ride is around 40 minutes.
- Potentially, there may be ways to incentize customers to ride for longer time periods like suggesting bike routes around the city or outdoor parks to ride around.

![Bike Sharing Analysis](https://github.com/mbroad1/Module-14-Bike-Sharing-Analysis/blob/main/Checkout%20Times%20for%20Gender.png)
- Males, females, and non-binary/unknown people all rent their bikes for around 20 minutes or less.
- Males are more likely to ride longer than 20 minutes in comparison to female or non-binary/unknown people.

![Bike Sharing Analysis](https://github.com/mbroad1/Module-14-Bike-Sharing-Analysis/blob/main/Trips%20by%20Gender.png)
- Males use NYC Citi Bike significantly more than females or non-binary/unknown people do, making them the target audience.
- However, this heat map shows that there is a lot of potential to gain more female and non-binary/unknown customers, so investing in marketing towards these groups could make the Des Moine bike sharing business more successful than the NYC Citi Bike business.

- Males are more likely to subscribe to the NYC Citi Bike service in comparison to females and non-binary/unknown people.
- This heat map shows that there is lots of opportunity to market to females and non-binary/unknown people about the benefits of subscribing to the service.
  - Potentially, there could be discounts to encourage people to join as subscribers if their first time users which would most likely target females and non-binary/unknown people more so than males who probably have used the service before.

## Summary:
- Overall, the visualizations clearly show the success of the NYC Citi Bike business, and thus, there is a great chance that it could be widely successful in the city of Des Moines.
- One visualization that would be interesting to see would be the yearly use of NYC Citi Bike by users on a month-to-month basis to see if the business is sustainable throughout the year.
  -  If it is widely successful throughout the year, this visualization would convince investors even more about the potential success of the business in Des Moines.
- Another visualization that would help with this pitch would be to see where males, females, and non-binary/unknown people are most likely to rent a bike and where they are most likely to stop riding a bike.
  -  Knowing these locations could help where to set up these bike shops in Des Moines and the marketing necessary to promote the locations of these shops in Des Moines.

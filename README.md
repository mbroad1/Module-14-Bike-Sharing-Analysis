- Of these millions of customers that rent their bikes in August, the vast majority are subscribers, meaning that they are regular customers that are likely to use the bikes more than just in the month of August.

- Typically, customers will ride for 20 minutes or less.
- The max time that they ride is around 40 minutes.
- Potentially, there may be ways to incentize customers to ride for longer time periods like suggesting bike routes around the city or outdoor parks to ride around.

![Bike Sharing Analysis](https://github.com/mbroad1/Module-14-Bike-Sharing-Analysis/blob/main/Checkout%20Times%20for%20Gender.png)
- Males, females, and non-binary/unknown people all rent their bikes for around 20 minutes or less.
- Males are more likely to ride longer than 20 minutes in comparison to female or non-binary/unknown people.

![Bike Sharing Analysis](https://github.com/mbroad1/Module-14-Bike-Sharing-Analysis/blob/main/Trips%20by%20Gender.png)
- Males use NYC Citi Bike significantly more than females or non-binary/unknown people do, making them the target audience.
- However, this heat map shows that there is a lot of potential to gain more female and non-binary/unknown customers, so investing in marketing towards these groups could make the Des Moine bike sharing business more successful than the NYC Citi Bike business.

- Males are more likely to subscribe to the NYC Citi Bike service in comparison to females and non-binary/unknown people.
- This heat map shows that there is lots of opportunity to market to females and non-binary/unknown people about the benefits of subscribing to the service.
  - Potentially, there could be discounts to encourage people to join as subscribers if their first time users which would most likely target females and non-binary/unknown people more so than males who probably have used the service before.
